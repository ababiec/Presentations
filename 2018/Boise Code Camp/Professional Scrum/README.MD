#### Professional Scrum
##### Journey to Ready (and back again) ...
1. A PBI can begin life with only a simple title ("Twitter feed on our homepage")
2. Next, add a short user story description ...
   "As a visitor to the home page,
    I want to see a list of recent tweets mentioning the company,
    so that I can see recent events"
3. PO becomes interested
4. PO assigns it a Business Value (the "R" in ROI)
   Consider using a Fibonacci sequence: 100, 200, 300, 500, 800, 1300, 2100
5. Acceptance criteria (what "done" looks like for this PBI)
   Example:
   * Show the latest 10 tweets in the feed
   * A tweet should arrive < 60 seconds
   * Should look/feel like the rest of the page
   * Include tweets from the @BCC
6. The Dev Team assigns a size in Product Backlog Refinement
   Consider usinga Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
7. If size < (velocity/2) then this item is "ready"
   velocity = sum of "Done" PBIs from the previous sprint(s)
