Join us for the monthly Lunch & Learn, to learn more about Technical Debt. The problem with doing things in a quick and dirty way, is that the dirty remains long after the quick is gone. Today’s development teams are constantly making trade-offs of time and quality in order to deliver working software on time. Since we have forecasts, goals, and commitments to achieve we can’t invest an inordinate amount of time locating the “optimal” answer or best practice. Solutions that are “fit for purpose” are good enough. In this session you will learn where waste and technical debt come from and, more importantly, some techniques for reducing and possibly removing them all together.
