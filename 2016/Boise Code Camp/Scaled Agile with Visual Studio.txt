Product Backlog breakdown

1. Epic        - things that executives, SLT, etc. care about
               - might take multiple releases/months to achieve
   (a.k.a. initiative, goal, theme, objective, etc.)

2. Feature     - things program managers, stakeholders care about
               - might take multiple sprints to achieve

3. User Story  - things that by definition can be done <=1 sprint


Note: all of the above are just Product Backlog Items (PBIs) in Scrum
