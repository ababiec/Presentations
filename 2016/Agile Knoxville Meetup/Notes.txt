Hey Richard, do you recommend our team/org try Scrum?

  (well, let me ask you some questions ...)

  1. Is your work complex?

   (there is more you DON't know about "what" is being asked,
      and "how" to deliver it)

  2. Can you work as a team?

  3. Do you primarily do planned work?

  4. Are you building an increment? 

  Yes to 3 or 4 of the above, Scrum; 1-2 maybe not
