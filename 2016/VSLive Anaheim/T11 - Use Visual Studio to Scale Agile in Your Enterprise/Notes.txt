"The three knobs"
---------------------------

To minize dependencies at scale, there are three knobs you can turn:

1. Change your teams (e.g. component/layer teams > feature teams)
2. Change your work (refine to break up, split, decide which team will deliver)
3. Change your architecture

Each of the above will have a varying "cost" and varying "benefit"

---------------------------
Different Backlog Levels
---------------------------

Do you have different types of stakeholders looking at your product backlog?

(Big) Epics - executives care about, years to deliver, mulitiple releases (might take a year+ to be done)
(Med) Features - stakeholders care about, several sprints to deliver
(Small) User stories - teams develop/deliver with 1 sprint or less
--
Tasks/Tests - not really a backlog, but the "plan" created by the DevTeam to deliver that sprint's forecast
