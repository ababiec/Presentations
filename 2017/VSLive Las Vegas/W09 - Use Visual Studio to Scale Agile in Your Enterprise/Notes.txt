---------------------------
Different Backlog Levels
---------------------------

Do you have different types of stakeholders looking at your product backlog?

(Big) Epics - executives care about, years to deliver, mulitiple releases (might take a year+ to be done); example: "Native iOS app"
(Med) Features - stakeholders care about, several sprints to deliver; example: "Online payments"
(Small) User stories - teams develop/deliver with 1 sprint or less; example: 
--
Tasks/Tests - not really a backlog, but the "plan" created by the DevTeam to deliver that sprint's forecast

---------------------------
Ideally, teams should be ...
---------------------------

* Self-organizing
* Cross-functional
* Cross-component (a.k.a. "a feature team")
* Collocated
* Made up of T-shaped people
