### Leverage Scrum and Visual Studio Team Services to Scale Your Development
SQLSoft3 Webinar | 1 Dec 2017

When many developers cooperate on the delivery of a single software product, they face unique challenges: dependencies, integration issues, and quality differentials. Scrum, as an empirical framework for addressing complex problems, is able to address these kinds of impediments. 

This webinar will a closer look at how you can use Scrum and Visual Studio Team Services to speed up development of critical software assets. No one knows better how to achieve this than Richard Hundhausen. He is the president of Accentient, a company that helps software teams deliver better products by understanding and leveraging Scrum and DevOps. 

Richard is a nationally-known certified Professional Scrum Trainer, Visual Studio and Development Technologies MVP, author of Professional Scrum Development with Microsoft Visual Studio, and co-creator of the Scaled Professional Scrum framework. 

In this presentation, Richard will introduce the Nexus and its new roles, events, and artifacts that provide an "exoskeleton" to existing Scrum teams, enabling them to scale effectively. Even if you have evaluated or adopted other scaling frameworks and methodologies or are just starting to experience the friction of software development at scale, come and be part of the conversation.
