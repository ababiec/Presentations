* Should you try Scrum? (some questions to consider)

1. Do you work as a team (of 3-9)?
2. Do you primarily do planned work (as opposed to unplanned/break-fix)?
3. Is the work complex (see Ralph Stacey complexity matrix)?
4. Is the individual work larger than a task (stories > 8 hrs work each)
5. Are you building an increment?
Did you answer Yes to 3+ questions, then try Scrum!
